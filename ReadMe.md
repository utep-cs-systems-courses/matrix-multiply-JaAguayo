The Program is a Matrix multiplier that takes either generated matrices or matrices from the files within the directory of the source code. 

The set test matrices are there to run the program, you can run the program in the IDE since there is a main or move to the directory where the source code is and type "python matrixMultiply.py" in the console to run it.

You can alter the matrices in the text files named, matrix1.txt and matrix2.txt. They must follow the format of the matrices already inputed in those files and the text files must be in the same directory as the source code.

There is a function in main calling a utlity function that can have the vaules altered in that function to change the size of the generated matrix and the values in the list from there, but they are set for testing.
