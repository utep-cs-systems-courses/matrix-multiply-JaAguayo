The Program is a Matrix multiplier that takes either generated matrices or matrices from the files within the directory of the source code. 

The set test matrices are there to run the program, you can run the program in the IDE since there is a main or move to the directory where the source code is and type "python matrixMultiply.py" in the console to run it.

You can alter the matrices in the text files named, matrix1.txt and matrix2.txt. They must follow the format of the matrices already inputed in those files and the text files must be in the same directory as the source code.

There is a function in main calling a utlity function that can have the vaules altered in that function to change the size of the generated matrix and the values in the list from there, but they are set for testing.

I had a problem with the taking the times for the computations since the time library is only for UNIX I haven't downloaded the VM yet so I coded this so far on windows VScode, so I had to use the timeit library to get the times which may need to be replaced once I download the VM 

I have a bug where I cannot get the new algorithm to work so far, so I am trying to work with the algorithm to try to figure it out 

It took around 2 hours to complete this program 

There are tests taking times from different size matrices when multiplying them
